EMAIL SPAM DETECTION

One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.

DESCRIPTION

‚Ä¢ Required packages installed, that are pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib.

‚Ä¢ Data Preprocessing, Classification and Classification report these are the operations performed

‚Ä¢ Logistic Regression used as classification model for this project to get high accuracy.

‚Ä¢ Visualising confusion matrix by heatmap to get clear performance of the classification model

‚Ä¢ Finally, Classification report has been executed.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Getting Started
1. You can access the raw data [here](https://github.com/ab-aruneswaran/Email_Spam_Detection/blob/main/dataset/spam.csv) within this repo.
2. All of the scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/ab-aruneswaran/Email_Spam_Detection/blob/main/Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb).


### Result 

 This Machine Learning Model achieves a high accuracy of 95% using Linear Regression , MultinomialNB .
#### I hope this will be useful someday, thankyou for seeing !‚úåüèª
